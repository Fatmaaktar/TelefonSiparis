# ðŸ“Œ Phone Order Application

This project is a small e-commerce application implemented with C# forms. The goal was to create a simple telephone order system. The application consists of two forms, and these forms are nested, allowing you to transition from one form to another based on the operation you perform. After entering your personal information on the first form, you are redirected to the second form. In this way, you can freely shop on the second form.

## ðŸš€Features

- Two nested forms for a seamless user experience.
- Personal information entry on the first form.
- Smooth transition to the second form for shopping purposes.

## âœ¨Usage

1. Open the application.
2. Fill in your personal information on the first form.
3. Proceed to the second form to explore and make purchases.
